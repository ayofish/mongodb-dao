example usage:

import BaseDao from "mongodb-dao-es6";

async function main() {
  const uri = "your_mongodb_connection_string";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const config = {
      dbName: "your_database_name",
      collection: "your_collection_name",
      sort: { _id: -1 },
      pageSize: 10,
    };

    const baseDao = new BaseDao(config, client);

    // Create a new document
    const newData = { name: "John Doe", age: 30 };
    const createdData = await baseDao.create(newData);
    console.log("Created Data:", createdData);

    // Find documents
    const foundData = await baseDao.find();
    console.log("Found Data:", foundData);
		
    // Find documents
		baseDao.match = { name: "John Doe", age: 30 };
    const foundData = await baseDao.find();
    console.log("Found Data:", foundData);

    // Update a document
    baseDao.id = createdData[0]._id;
    const updatedData = await baseDao.update({ age: 31 });
    console.log("Updated Data:", updatedData);

    // Delete a document
    const deletedData = await baseDao.delete();
    console.log("Deleted Data:", deletedData);

  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

**Explanation:**

* **Import Statements:** The code imports the necessary modules: `MongoClient` from the `mongodb` package and `BaseDao` from the `mongodb-dao-es6` package.
* **Connection Setup:**  It establishes a connection to your MongoDB database using the provided connection string (`uri`).
* **Configuration:**  The `config` object defines the database name, collection name, sorting criteria, and page size for pagination.
* **BaseDao Instance:**  A new instance of the `BaseDao` class is created, using the provided configuration and the established client.
* **CRUD Operations:** The code demonstrates the following CRUD operations:
    * **Create:**  The `create` method is used to insert a new document into the collection.
    * **Find:**  The `find` method retrieves documents from the collection.
    * **Update:**  The `update` method modifies an existing document.
    * **Delete:**  The `delete` method removes a document from the collection.
* **Error Handling:**  A `try...catch` block handles potential errors during the database operations.
* **Connection Closure:**  The `finally` block ensures that the database connection is closed properly, even if an error occurs.

**Important Notes:**

* **Replace Placeholders:**  Remember to replace `"your_mongodb_connection_string"`, `"your_database_name"`, and `"your_collection_name"` with your actual MongoDB connection details.
* **Package Installation:**  Make sure you have the `mongodb-dao-es6` package installed in your project. You can install it using `npm install mongodb-dao-es6`.
